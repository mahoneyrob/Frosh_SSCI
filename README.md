# Frosh_SSCI

In this project I analyzed the freshman social science sequence.  I started by querying the data with SQL, and extracted csv files.  These files were loaded in to python with the panda's library, cleaned a bit more, and processed in to lists to be used with matplotlib.  I created visualizations that reflected the difference in curriculum for the freshman corses.
